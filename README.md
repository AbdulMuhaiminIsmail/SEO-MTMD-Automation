# SEO-MTMD-Automation

This project automates the end-to-end process of generating SEO-optimized meta titles and meta descriptions for every page of a WordPress website. It fetches URLs from the site's sitemap, uses AI to generate metadata in batches, and compiles everything into a clean, import-ready CSV file. The results are also accessible via Google Sheets for easy review and editing.
